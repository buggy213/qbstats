Each leaf of the tree represented by these lists corresponds to one line in the data file, unless clearly indicated otherwise.

Number of teams
For each team:
    1 plus the number of players (i.e., information on how many of the following lines to associate with this team)

    Each player name on a separate line. (This leaf node in our documentation represents as many lines as there are players on a given team.)
Number of matches
For each match:
    Id
    0-based index of the team shown on the left in the Game Entry screen
    0-based index of the team shown on the right in the Game Entry screen

        (right team Bonuses Heard) + (10000 * right team BncBks)
        (right team Bonuses [sic] Pts) + (10000 * right team [bounceback] Pts)

    The following a total of 16 times. It starts with the first player on the left team, then it's the first player on the right team, then the second player on the left team, then the second player on the right team, etc., until each team has had eight players (or all-zero blocks) listed.

        Number of questions answered for the third possible point value. If this point value is not used or this slot is not used for a player, then 0. Commonly, this is the number of negs.
        Number of questions answered for the fourth possible point value. If this point value is not used or this slot is not used for a player, then 0. Commonly, this is not used and is therefore 0.
        Total points scored by this player, or 0 if this slot is not used for a player.

If "Sort Players by Pts/TUH" is enabled (in the Sorting tab of Settings) then 1, otherwise 0
A bit mask for the "Warnings" tab in Settings. Start with 0; add 128 if the first is enabled, add 64 if the second is enabled, and so on, up to adding 2 if the seventh is enabled, so 254 represents all warnings enabled.
If round report is enabled (in the Reports tab of Settings) then 1, otherwise 0

The User Name (from the FTP tab of Settings)
The Directory (from the FTP tab of Settings)
The Base File Name (from the FTP tab of Settings)
If "Always use '/' in paths" in the FTP tab of settings is false, and "British-Style Reports" in the Reports tab of settings is false, then 0. If /-in-paths is true and British is false, then 1. If /-in-paths is false and British is true, then 2. If both are true, then 3. (This is oddly complex; one assumes that this line originally represented just "Always use '/' in paths", then the "British-Style Reports" option was created later and its value incorporated into this line to avoid breaking backward-compatibility.)
